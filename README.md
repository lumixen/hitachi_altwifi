# Hitachi_altwifi

## Overview
Replacing the vendor firmware of the Hitachi AirHome 400 (and possibly other models) WiFi module with a custom version based on ESPHome.

Since recent versions of Hitachi AC are shipped with integrated WiFi connectivity, it is not necessary to add custom hardware. Instead, it is possible to flash a custom firmware onto the WiFi module.

## Usage
Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/clsergent/hitachi_altwifi/blob/main/Instructions.md) to flash your custom firmware.

Once done, next updates can be done OTA using Esphome. No special instructions are required then.

[Libretiny documentation](https://docs.libretiny.eu/docs/platform/realtek-ambz/#flashing) states: "Because the UART uploading code is programmed in the ROM of the chip, it can't be software-bricked, even if you damage the bootloader". This means that it should be safe to flash custom firmware. However, you remain responsible if any problems occur.

Use the provided [model configuration file](https://github.com/clsergent/hitachi_altwifi/blob/main/build/device-model.yaml) to build your own firmware.


## Compatibility list
This list references tested models only. If another model is compatible, please report it to help extend this list.
- RAK-DJ18RH
- RAK-DJ50RH

## Protocol handling
This project initially relied on custom firmware from [esphome-hlink-ac](https://github.com/lumixen/esphome-hlink-ac).
However, firmware decompilation as well as UART sniffing revealed a new, undocumented [protocol](https://github.com/clsergent/hitachi_altwifi/blob/main/Protocol.md), which, for convenience, will be referred to as *hlink2*.

A new firmware targeting *hlink2* is now available. It supports additional features such as 0.5 °C temperature increments.
The firmware has been successfully tested on at least two AC units for more than a year without any problem.

Discovered AC endpoints have been gathered in the [mnemonics](https://github.com/clsergent/hitachi_altwifi/blob/main/Mnemonics.md) file.
